1. **Dashboard**: Use `/dashboard/complete` instead of multiple calls
2. **Caching**: Cache dashboard data for 5-10 minutes
3. **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets
4. **Indexes**: Ensure database indexes on frequently queried fields
5. **Batch Operations**: Use bulk upload for multiple employees
